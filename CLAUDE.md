# Healstack
v2.2.0

Renamed from Dose 2026-07-01 (Dose, Balm, Tonic, and several others all taken on the App Store — Healstack cleared). GitHub repo renamed to nulljosh/healstack, domain moved to healstack.heyitsmejosh.com. Bundle IDs, App Group, and URL scheme (dose://) intentionally left as `dose` to avoid re-provisioning/App Store relinking.

## Shipped (2026-06-28)
- [x] ToS checkbox required on register tab — `src/pages/Auth.jsx`, `/tos.html`
- [x] GitHub Sign In button via Supabase OAuth
- [x] GitHub provider enabled in Supabase (spark project) via management API

## Rules
- Portfolio vibe design (Geist font, flat monochrome + blue accent, no shadows/gradients)
- Mobile-first, bottom nav, safe-area-inset support
- Supabase auth: login, register, password reset (PASSWORD_RECOVERY event flow)
- Interaction checker must warn when logging substance that interacts with active stack
- No emojis

## Run
```bash
npm run dev       # Dev server
npm test          # Run tests
npm run build     # Production build
./deploy.sh       # Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (direct-upload)
```

## Deploy
Migrated from Vercel to Cloudflare Pages 2026-08-06. Direct-upload via `wrangler pages deploy` (not git-connected, to avoid staleness). Serverless functions ported to Cloudflare Pages Functions (`functions/api/stripe.js`, `functions/api/stripe-webhook.js`, `functions/api/sync.js`). KV namespace binding for sync data (`DOSE_KV`, id `933180aeff6b45e58e39b258b2fbe25b`). Secrets managed via `wrangler pages secret put`; run locally via `wrangler pages dev dist`. Custom domain must be explicitly attached via Pages API (`POST .../pages/projects/healstack/domains`) — a DNS CNAME alone is not enough, causes 522 until the domain is registered on the Pages project itself. `DOSE_SYNC_TOKEN` secret set fresh 2026-08-06 (Cloudflare KV was empty pre-migration — Vercel used a separate `@vercel/kv` store, no data migration needed); real app users need this token in their browser's `dose:sync_token` localStorage key. Cloudflare secret updates take ~1-2 min to propagate across all edge PoPs — expect transient 401s on `/api/sync` right after a `wrangler pages secret put`, not a bug.

- xcodegen generate && xcodebuild build -scheme Dose -project Dose.xcodeproj -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro"

## Pending
- .env.local recreated 2026-06-12 (VITE_SUPABASE_* + HEALSTACK_EMAIL/HEALSTACK_PASSWORD) — file is gone again as of 2026-06-20, needs recreating.
- Account recovery: real account email is jatrommel@gmail.com (not trommatic@icloud.com). Reset password to that address rather than chasing the icloud reset email further.
- Supabase anon key no longer hardcoded in `ios/Services/AuthService.swift` — now read via `infoPlistValue("SUPABASE_ANON_KEY")` from Info.plist (fixed 2026-06-23).
- Web UI refresh, landing page, and iOS ship are tracked in README Roadmap (Declutter UI, Vibe clone portfolio aesthetic, iOS companion app) — not new asks, no changes applied yet.
- Stripe secrets (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, real STRIPE_PRICE_ID) not set on Cloudflare — deliberately deferred 2026-08-06 (app is free/personal, $1 CSV-export gate isn't load-bearing). `functions/api/stripe.js`/`stripe-webhook.js` are deployed and respond correctly (400s on missing config, no crashes) but the Pro-unlock flow won't work until these are set.
