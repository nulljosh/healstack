# Launch checklist — Healstack

This kit is web-first: every public link (PH, HN, Reddit, X) points only to
https://healstack.heyitsmejosh.com, no App Store link anywhere in the copy.

Aside, for Joshua only, not for public copy: `asc versions list --app 6785764864`
shows iOS 2.3.5 is actually READY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION / READY_FOR_SALE (live),
while iOS 2.3.6 and macOS 2.3.5 are both REJECTED. So there is a live iOS
build right now, but macOS has no approved build, and the newest iOS
submission was rejected. Given the mixed state, this kit stays web-only
until you decide the store side is stable enough to advertise.

## Joshua does by hand
- [ ] PH: create the post from launch/producthunt.md, upload launch/gallery/*, pick a launch day (Tue-Thu, early Pacific morning tends to work best for this fleet's past launches).
- [ ] PH: line up a hunter if not self-hunting.
- [ ] HN: post launch/hn.md manually as "Show HN" (title must literally start with "Show HN:", already does).
- [ ] Reddit: post each launch/reddit/*.md one at a time, per launch/reddit/checklist.md, checking karma/account-age/flair per sub first (ask, don't guess).
- [ ] X: post launch/x.md as a 3-post thread.

## Gaps noted
- Gallery: only 1 desktop screenshot (macos/home.png) and 3 phone screenshots existed. Resized macos/home.png to 1270x760 for the PH first-image slot; the 3 phone shots were copied as-is (portrait, not 3:2), fine as secondary gallery images but not ideal as a lead image.
- No dedicated OG image existed on the live site; generated launch/gallery-derived og.png and wired it into the landing page (see SEO section below).
